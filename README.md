# Stream-Cypher
Implementation for Present Stream Cypher

Usage:

python server.py  (this will ask for a port to bind)

python client.py (this will ask for the server's ip and port)

After the client module is up the server will ask for a the path of the file we want to send, the file will be encrypted in the server and decrypted in the client.

The client will generate the decrypted file on the local machine.
